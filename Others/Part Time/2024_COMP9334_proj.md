# Project Report
## 1. Project Description.
My project is an upgrade based on the sample code. Following are changes that I have made on the original code.
- Reading data from configuration files.
		I created a function  `read_configs` to help read configuration files. It takes the sequence number of test cases as parameter and returns contents from corresponding files. This function would return raw string for following initialization process.
	
- Multi-server simulation update.

  ​	I introduced `deque` to simulate waiting queues of group 0 and group 1; a couple of `list` to simulate the switching between the running and idle states of servers; a data structure similar to that in the project documentation to describe jobs, to assist in the job assignment and scheduling process. Also, I modified the main loop termination condition so that it could adapt both random and trace mode.

- Initialize for different mode.

  ​	I created an initialization function for parameter parsing, trace  mode and random mode respectively. The init function for trace mode simply parses the parameters and return. The random mode init function would randomly generate data based on given rules with input parameters, which would be introduced in the following section. In order to simplify the subsequent simulation, this function would generate all data from 0 to `time_end` at once. This makes the two init functions have structurally identical return values.

## 2. Random Data Generation and verification.

The parameters for testing data generation and verification are listed as below.

$\lambda=3.1,a_{2l}=0.85,a_{2u}=1.21,p_0=0.74,\alpha_0=0.5,\beta_0=5.7,\eta_0=1.9,\alpha_1=2.7,\eta_1=2.5$

### 2.1 Probability Distribution of Inter_arrival Time

​	As given in the project documentation, the generation rules of inter_arrival times refers is as follow.
$$
\{a_k\mid a_k=a_{1k}\times a_{2k},k\in \Z\},
\left\{
\begin{array}{**lr**}
a_{1k}\sim E(\lambda),\\
a_{2k}\sim U(a_{2l},2_{2u})
\end{array}
\right.
$$
​	The main task of this section is to generate a sequence of random numbers that follow the exponential distribution and a sequence of random numbers that follow the uniform distribution in a given interval.

​	I use the `expovariate` function in Python library `random` to generate the exponential distribution sequence, and the `uniform` function to generate the uniform distribution sequence. The comparison results are as follow.

​	As shown in above figure, the distribution of generated data obeys target distribution.

### 2.2 Probability Distribution of Job's Group Number

​	As given in the project documentation, the generation rules of a job's group number refers is as follow.
$$
P(n=0)=p_0\\P(n=1)=1-p_0
$$
​	I use the `choices` function from Python library `random` to sample the data. The verification uses same method as above. The result is shown as below.

​	Obviously, the distribution of sampled data obeys the given rule.

### 2.3 Probability Distribution of Service Time

​	As given in the project documentation, the generation rules of a job's service time refers is as follow.
$$
\begin{array}{lr}
g(t)=\left\{
\begin{array}{**lr**}
0& for& 0\le t \le \alpha_0\\
\frac{\eta_0}{(\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-\beta_0^{-\eta_0})t^{\eta_0+1}} & for & \alpha_0\lt t \lt \beta_0\\
0 & for & t\ge \beta_0
\end{array}
\right.&group=0\\ \\
g(t)=\left\{
\begin{array}{**lr**}
0& for& 0\le t \le \alpha_1\\
\frac{\eta_1}{\alpha_1^{-\eta_1}t^{\eta_1+1}} & for & \alpha_1 \le t
\end{array}\quad
\right.&group=1
\end{array}
$$

​	Service time is a random number that follows the distribution with a probability density function of g(t) respectively. The main task of this section is to use the inverse transform method to generate random sequences that follows the above distribution. The cumulative density function `cdf(x)` and its inverse function `icdf(x)` can be derived as follow.

g = 0:
$$
\begin{split}
cdf(x) &= \int^x_{\alpha_0}\frac{\eta_0}{(\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-\beta_0^{-\eta_0})}\times t^{-\eta_0-1}dt \\
&=\frac{\eta_0}{\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-\beta_0^{-\eta_0}}\times\frac{1}{-\eta_0}\times t^{-\eta_0}\mid^x_{\alpha_0}\\
&=\frac{\alpha^{-\eta_0}-x^{-\eta_0}}{\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-\beta_0^{-\eta_0}}\\
icdf(x)&=\sqrt[-\eta_0]{\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-(\alpha_0^{-\eta_0}-\beta_0^{-\eta_0})\times x}, x\in U[0,1]

\end{split}
$$
g=1:
$$
\begin{split}
cdf(x) &= \int^x_{\alpha_1}\frac{\eta_1}{\alpha_1^{-\eta_1}}\times t^{-\eta_1-1}dt \\ 
&=\frac{\eta_1}{\alpha_1^{-\eta_1}}\times \frac{1}{-\eta_1}\times t^{-\eta_1}\mid^x_{\alpha_1}\\
&=1-\frac{x^{-\eta_1}}{\alpha_1^{-\eta_1}}\\
icdf(x)&=\sqrt[-\eta_1]{1-x}\times\alpha_1^{-\eta_1},x\in U[0,1]


\end{split}
$$
​	The correctness of the generated data is verified with the same method as above. The result is shown as follow.

​	As shown in above figure, the distribution of generated data obeys target distribution.

## 3. Determining the Parameter $n_0$ That Minises the Mean Response Time.

​	In order to find the value of $n_0$ that minimizes the mean response time, I conducted simulations with different values of $n_0$ while keeping other parameters constant. The other parameters in each simulation, except for $n_0$, are as follows:	 

$\lambda=3.1,a_{2l}=0.85,a_{2u}=1.21,p_0=0.74,\alpha_0=0.5,\beta_0=5.7,\eta_0=1.9,\alpha_1=2.7,\eta_1=2.5,time_end=200,n=10$

​	Since both service time and requested group number are randomly generated, there may be situations where the system capacity is not fully utilized over a period of time. Therefore, to eliminate the impact of this situation, time_end is set to 200, allowing the system to run for a sufficiently long time to 'warm up' and ensure that all servers are utilized.	

​	However, this method cannot completely eliminate the impact of transient state, so I introduced the transient removal method to solve this problem. By simply introducing a flag in the program as a sign, setting the flag to True when a new job is first assigned to the waiting queue, and only recording the MRT after this point can address this issue.

​	To minimize the impact of random data initialization and other random factors, I conducted 1000 simulations for each different value of $n_0$ and took the average mean response time value as the mean response time for the current parameter setting. The relationship between MRT and different values of $n_0$ is shown in the following graph.

![](/home/bryandu/Note/obsidian/note/Others/Part%20Time/2024_COMP9334_proj.assets/avg_mrt_decide_n0.png)

​	As shown in the graph, MRT decreases continuously as $n_0$ increases from 1 to 4. The minimum MRT is achieved when $n_0$ reaches 5, then it start to increase as $n_0$ increases. Therefore, it can be concluded that for this specific system ,the MRT is minimized and the system efficiency is maximized when $n_0$ is set to 5.
