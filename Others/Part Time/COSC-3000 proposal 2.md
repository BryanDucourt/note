# Ray Tracing Rendering Project
**What - What is the topic and goal of your project?**
- **Topic:** Creating a highly realistic three-dimensional scene rendering using ray tracing algorithms.
- **Goal:** To develop a ray tracing rendering engine that simulates complex lighting effects such as reflections, refractions, and shadows to produce lifelike visual effects.
**Why - Why is your project important or interesting?**
- Ray tracing technology is used in computer graphics to produce high-quality images with very high visual realism, widely used in movie and high-end animation production.
- Unlike traditional rasterization rendering, ray tracing more accurately simulates how light travels in the real world, though it has a higher computational cost.
- The project is not only a technical challenge but also an artistic creation process that enhances capabilities in high-performance computing and algorithm optimization.
**How - How will you achieve the project's goal?**
- By coding to implement a basic ray tracing engine using programming languages like C++ or Python. I haven't decided witch programming language I would use yet.
- Implementing fundamental algorithms for ray interactions with objects, physically accurate algorithms for ray reflections and refractions.
- Designing scenes including setting up various materials, light sources, and simulating effects in the environment.
- Analyzing rendering results, comparing different algorithms and optimization techniques to achieve optimal rendering efficiency and image quality.
**Data - What is your data source, and how will you obtain it?**
- **Data source:** 3D model data can be obtained from open-source databases such as the Blender Model Repository or TurboSquid.
- **Method of acquisition:** Download existing 3D model data or create custom models using 3D modeling software like Blender.
**Graphics - What graphics tools will you use, and what techniques will you demonstrate?**
- **Graphics Tools:** Primarily the self-developed ray tracing engine. Supplementary tools may include OpenGL or DirectX for initial scene setup and debugging.
- **Techniques Demonstrated:** Advanced ray tracing techniques such as path tracing, photon mapping, and volume rendering.
- The results will showcase high-quality images produced by ray tracing rendering technology, as well as the effects of different techniques used during the rendering process.
