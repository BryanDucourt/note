## Design

- sender

  - overall

  ​	The sender consists of three threads: the main thread, the receiving thread, and the timer thread. Among them, the `main` thread is responsible for receiving command-line arguments, initializing other threads, reading data, and other preparatory work, while also handling the sending of data packets. The `receiving` thread is responsible for receiving the ack data sent by the receiver, and handles events such as timer timeouts and duplicate acks. It also manages the updating of the sliding window and packets in it. The timer thread is responsible for starting a timer for a specified duration and updating a shared variable to notify other threads when the time expires. By creating a custom timer object, it provides start, stop, and reset methods, and ensures that only one timer exists at any given time.

  - simulate of random packet loss

  ​	To simulate random packet loss, I encapsulated two functions to take over the work of socket's send and recv. Before executing the socket functions, a check is performed based on a specified probability. If the condition is met, the execution continues; otherwise, it is skipped.

  - wrapped sequence number

  ​	Since the Initial Sequence Number (ISN) is randomly initialized within the range of 0-65535, there may be cases where the sequence number exceeds the limit of 65535 during transmission. To address this issue, I designed a wrap-around for the sequence number. When it exceeds 65535, it wraps back to 0 and continues counting. Appropriate checks are also implemented in the code at corresponding locations.

- receiver

  - overall

  ​	The receiver is much simpler compared to the sender; it only needs to handle duplicated or out-of-order arriving packets. In the receiver, a physical sliding window structure is maintained using a list to temporarily store out-of-order packets. When appropriate, it outputs all contiguous data at once.

- data-structure

  ​	For programming convenience, I created a packet class to uniformly manage the messages received and sent. This class offers two initialization methods: from bytes and from variables, to accommodate different scenarios in receiving and sending. Additionally, the class provides a `to_bytes` method, which is used to convert the message data into a format that meets the requirements of the task for sending.

## Public code announcement

​	I borrowed the command line arguments parse functions and initializing code segments from the given sample code. Apart from that, the rest of the code is original.
