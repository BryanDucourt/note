**Reasons for Choosing the Project**
- Ray tracing is an advanced rendering technology capable of producing realistic image effects, which is highly appealing to me.
- Its application in movie production, game development, and high-end visual effects demonstrates its importance and practical value.
- As a computer science student, I wanted to deepen my understanding of how ray tracing works through practical experience.

**How I Implemented This Project**
- Research and Planning: I first thoroughly studied the theory of ray tracing and its existing implementations, especially the Whitted-style ray tracing.
- Mathematical Foundations: I learned the mathematical representation of rays and geometric bodies (like spheres) and their interactions, including reflection and refraction.
- Programming Practice: I chose Python for development and used the numpy library for efficient numerical computations.
- Object-Oriented Design: I applied object-oriented programming principles, creating different classes to represent rays, materials, textures, etc.
- Function Implementation: I gradually implemented basic ray tracing effects, including diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and rendering of transparent materials.
- Textures and Materials: I explored various types of textures, such as checkerboards, solid colors, and image textures, and implemented various material effects.
- Lighting Effects: I also experimented with creating self-luminous objects and simulated the impact of lighting on the scene.

**Reflections Learned from the Project**
- Theoretical and Practical Integration: Through this project, I applied theoretical knowledge to actual programming, deepening my understanding of ray tracing technology.
- Problem Solving: During the project, I faced several technical challenges, such as performance optimization and image quality improvement, which honed my problem-solving skills.
