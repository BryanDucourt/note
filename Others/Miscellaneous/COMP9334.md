# Question 1
## (a)
From given data we know that
$$
\begin{matrix}
U(1)=\frac {B(1)}{T} = \frac{1015}{1800} \\X(0)=\frac{C(0)}{T}=\frac{67}{1800}
\end{matrix}
$$
therefore, apply the service demand law,
$$ D(1)=\frac{U(1)}{X(0)}\approx15.15s$$
## (b)
Consider both CPU cores and the disk are standalone devices{d(1),d(2),d(3)},  we know that
$$
X\le \min (\frac{1}{\max D_i},\frac{N}{\Sigma^3_{i=1}D_i})
$$
by sevice demand law, we have
$$ D_1=15.86,D_2=22.87,D_3=14.73 $$
by little's law, we have$$N_{avg}=R_{avg}*X_{avg}$$
and by interactive response time law, we have$$M=X(0)*(Z+R)$$
with M=19,Z=45 and X(0) from above, we have R=465.44, therefore N = 17.33.
with these known parameters, we have
$$X\le \min (\frac{1}{\max D_i},\frac{N}{\Sigma^3_{i=1}D_i})=\min(\frac{1}{22.87},\frac{17.33}{53.46})=0.043$$
the upper bound of throughput is 0.043 req/seq
## (c)
Since both cores have the same processing rate, to balance the utilisations of the 2 cores, we aim to distribute the requests evenly between them, i.e. they have the same busy time. Hence, for balanced cores, $B_1=B_2=\frac{1015+1532}{2}=1273.5,D_1=D_2=19$,
