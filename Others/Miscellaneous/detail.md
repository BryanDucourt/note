# What method you use.
We use the Negamax algorithm to search the decision tree and employ the alpha-beta algorithm for pruning. Negamax algorithm is a variant form of minimax algorithm, which simplifies the search process, making the code more concise and easier to understand.
# Any unique aspects to it that you have developed.
